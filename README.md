# Assignment 3 : Branching Strategies & Merge Conflicts

In this assignment I have made two branches and tried to make the same changes on the same part of the html file.

# pushing to main branch

# pushing from feature/update-styling branch

# pushing from feature/add-content branch

# merge conflict for the second branch

# resolution process

So, I keep both the changes for the final commit to resolve the issue
